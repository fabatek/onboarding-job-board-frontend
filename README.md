# Job board - Onboarding project

### Definition of Done (DoD)

One feature is done if it meets all these conditions:
- Completed all requirements for that feature. 
- Covered by unit tests.
- Deployed to a server for users to use it (recommend [Surge service](https://surge.sh/) for deployment).

### Requirements
We want to create a job board that is similar to [ITviec](https://itviec.com/). Please use https://mockapi.io/ to create API.

You can find all tickets on the [project board](https://github.com/fabatek/onboarding-job-board-frontend/projects). We sorted all the tickets by order, so you need to complete all the tickets one by one. Please take a look at DoD above to see how we define a completed ticket.

### Recommended technologies:
- React Hooks.
- TypeScript.
- Redux and Redux-thunk to manage state and async requests.
- Bootstrap and SASS for styling.
- Axios for sending requests to API endpoints.

### Available Scripts
- Start project `yarn start` at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Run unit tests `yarn test`
