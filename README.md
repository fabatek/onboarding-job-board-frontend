# Faba onboarding project - Job board

### Definition of Done (DoD)

One feature is done if it meets all these conditions:
- Completed all requirements for that feature. 
- Covered by unit tests.
- Deployed to a server for users to use it (recommend [Surge service](https://surge.sh/) for deployment).

### Requirements
We want to create a job board that is similar to [ITviec](https://itviec.com/). We defined [the job API](https://remotive.io/api/remote-jobs) already.

You can find all tickets on the [project board](https://github.com/leofaba/job_board/projects). We sorted all the tickets by order, so you need to complete all the tickets one by one. Please take a look at DoD above to see how we define a completed ticket.
